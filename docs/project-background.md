# Project Background

Last updated: 2026-07-06

## Purpose

This project is being prepared as a public personal bio / portfolio template. The goal is to let people fork or clone it, replace the sample content, deploy it on Vercel, and maintain their profile through a visual admin editor.

The project should feel like an actual usable personal page, not a marketing landing page for the template itself. The first screen should show the owner profile and content cards.

## Product Model

- The public site is a personal homepage.
- The admin site is a visual editor for the same homepage.
- The content source of truth is a single validated `SiteConfig` object.
- Vercel Blob stores the production config and uploaded images.
- `lib/default-site-config.ts` is sample fallback content for local development and fresh deployments.

## Important Mental Model

The old `sections` concept is now represented as `Block` records with `type: "section"` and `size: "section-text"`. They are full-width text blocks, not containers that own block cards.

All content blocks use the internal `__top_level__` section id. Normal cards and full-width text blocks share one vertical content-order axis. This lets a text block move above, below, or between card groups without making cards feel like children of that text block.

Do not normalize top-level block `sortOrder` as if it were section-local order. A top-level block's `sortOrder` controls where it appears relative to text sections, so unrelated top-level siblings should keep their global order when another block is dragged or resized.

Block cards should be able to move before or after a text block on the shared content axis. The editor should not force a card into a hidden section-owned grid just because the pointer is near a heading.

If an older config has `sections`, normalize each section into a `type: "section"` block. If an older config has `block.sectionId` pointing at a section, normalize it into the shared content flow and rewrite the block to `__top_level__`; do not preserve section-owned card groups.

Do not reintroduce visible blank sections as placeholders. If blocks are detached from a section, make them top-level blocks.

## Main Files

- `app/page.tsx`: public page entry.
- `app/admin/page.tsx`: protected admin entry.
- `components/admin/AdminVisualEditor.tsx`: primary admin editor.
- `components/admin/ImageCropUploader.tsx`: shared image upload/crop dialog.
- `components/admin/BlockForm.tsx`: block editing form.
- `components/site/SiteLayout.tsx`: public layout shell.
- `components/site/ContentArea.tsx`: ordered public content rendering.
- `components/blocks/BlockCard.tsx`: main block card renderer.
- `lib/utils.ts`: render model, ordering helpers, top-level block id.
- `lib/validators.ts`: config validation.
- `lib/blob-config.ts`: Vercel Blob read/write.
- `lib/default-site-config.ts`: sample fallback config.

## Design Direction

- Quiet, content-first personal page.
- Dense but approachable admin UI.
- Avoid large hero marketing sections.
- Avoid decorative gradient blobs or one-note palettes.
- Keep controls direct and concrete: icons for actions, segmented choices for layout, handles for drag/resize.
- Admin behavior should match the visual public page closely.

## Public Responsive Layout

The public page has three layout modes:

- Wide desktop: if the viewport has enough width, render the profile module as the left desktop column and render the content modules on the right. The whole shell is centered as `left profile + right content`.
- Narrow desktop / tablet: if the viewport is not wide enough for the two-column desktop shell, stack the profile area above the content area. The content area should keep the personal-site module layout below it instead of forcing a cramped side-by-side layout.
- Mobile: at the narrow phone breakpoint, use the mobile module layout. Block grids use the mobile two-column logical grid, so square blocks can sit left/right and wider blocks span the full mobile content width.

The right content width should be content-aware on desktop. It should use at least two logical columns because text blocks need readable width, and expand to three logical columns only when visible blocks actually use the third column. Text blocks themselves should not force the content area to become three columns.

## Current Constraints

- No database beyond Vercel Blob.
- No multi-user accounts.
- No public write APIs.
- Admin authentication is a single password hash plus signed session cookie.
- Image uploads are public Blob objects.
- Config history and migrations are not yet implemented.

## Future Development Ideas

- Template initialization wizard.
- Import/export config JSON.
- Config backup and restore.
- Richer block templates.
- Better migration handling for older configs.
- Optional analytics integration.
- Theme presets.
